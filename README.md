## Overview

Ground-level street-view imagery is critical for post-disaster damage assessment, yet is often unavailable immediately after events due to access constraints. This project benchmarks whether **realistic and semantically consistent street views can be synthesized from satellite imagery**, and evaluates how different generative paradigms perform under this cross-view setting.

## Evaluated Methods

| Method | Paradigm | Key Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| **Pix2Pix** | Conditional GAN | Preserves spatial layout; prone to texture blur |
| **SD 1.5 + ControlNet** | Diffusion | High realism; may underestimate fine-grained damage |
| **ControlNet + VLM (Gemini)** | Diffusion + Semantic | Damage-aware; possible semantic–geometry tension |
| **Disaster-MoE** | Mixture of Experts | Severity-adaptive; decouples structure from texture |

## Results

### Qualitative Comparison

### Semantic Consistency (ResNet-18 Classifier)

![Confusion Matrices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rayford295/Sat2Street-DisasterGen/main/Figure/confusion_matrices_comparison.png)

- **SD 1.5 + ControlNet** achieves the highest semantic consistency (F1 ≈ 0.71)
- **Pix2Pix** exhibits strong mode collapse toward *mild* damage predictions
- **Gemini-guided and MoE** improve visual realism with a slight trade-off in class separability
